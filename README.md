# Python for Data Science
Files for the Python for Data Science workshops, presented by the IDEA Student Center at UC San Diego.

## Topics
Data Science is relevant to a wide range of disciplines and applications, which are too numerous to be covered in a single workshop. Instead, the files in this repository focus on a subset of some of the more common Data Science topics and skills:
- data files: reading/writing
- data visualization
- time-series analysis
- regression
- classification
- statistics

## Requirements
- Python 2 or 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## Installation
We *highly* recommend installing Python using Anaconda, an all-in-one installer that includes everything we will need for the workshop (Python + essential packages). To install:
1. go to the Anaconda download page: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
2. download the Python 3.x graphical installer for your OS
3. run the installer

**NOTE**: The installer download is large (approx. 600 MB) and installation (after downloading) can take 10â€“20 mins to run.
